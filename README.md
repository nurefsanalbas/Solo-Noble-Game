# Solo-Noble-Game
I made a Solo Noble Game with java programming language.
Solo Test is a single-player board game with the aim of placing pawns in all holes, 
leaving the center hole empty. A move is made by jumping the pawn behind any of the four pawns around the empty hole and placing it in the hole by jumping over the pawn in front of it,and the jumped pawn is taken.
